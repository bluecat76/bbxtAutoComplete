= bbxtAutocomplete - BareBones Edit/TextWrangler plug-in

UPDATE: Barebones removed the BBXT Plug-In interface from TextWrangler with version 3.5, 
therefore this solution isn't working any more.
You can use the new script version TwAutoComplete from here: 
http://github.com/bluecat76/TwAutoComplete

== Introduction

This plug-in is an extension to BareBones TextWrangler (http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/). 
On invocation, it gives you an auto-completion for the word your cursor is on, similar to those found in 
IDEs. It does this by looking through all words found in the current document only, but this can really save 
you time nonetheless.

== Installation

Building from source or extracting the release file should yield a folder named AutoComplete.bbxt. 
Simply drag this folder to your TextWrangler App-icon to install it. It should now be 
visible in the Menu as Item "Tools/AutoComplete".

Then set a key combination to run it (f.i. CTRL-SPACE). You can do this by selecting 
"Window/Palettes/Plug-In Tools" in the Menu and using the "Set Key..." button for the 
AutoComplete tool.

== Usage

You can use the selected key kombination to complete the word you begin to write. Use the 
key kombination repeatedly to switch through all available completion possibilities.
If you have f.i. a text like 'This is a test text.' and you invoke AutoComplete after 
writing a 't' afterwards, you get 'est' and on the next invocation 'ext' as completion selection. 

== Building From Source

To build the AutoComplete plug-in using the XCode project, you will need the BareBones 
Plug-In SDK from this page: http://www.barebones.com/support/develop/
