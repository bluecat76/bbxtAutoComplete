== bbxtAutocomplete - BareBones Edit/TextWrangler plug-in

= Introduction

This plug-in is an extension to BareBones TextWrangler (http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/). 
On invocation, it gives you an auto-completion for the word your cursor is on, similar to those found in 
IDEs. It does this by looking through all words found in the current document only, but this can really save 
you time nonetheless.
